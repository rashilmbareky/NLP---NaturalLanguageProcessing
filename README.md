# NLP- Natural Language Processing
This repository features four exercises designed to explore Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks using Hebrew texts from the Knesset protocols. The exercises take you through different stages of NLP, such as creating a corpus, performing text classification, building language models, and applying word embeddings.

## Exercise 1: Corpus Creation and Text Processing
This exercise involves building a text corpus from the Knesset protocols, stored as Word documents.It involves several key steps:
- Text extraction
- Sentence splitting
- Tokenization
- Data cleaning (removing non-Hebrew and malformed sentences)

In addition, this exercise incorporates Zipf's Law to analyze frequency distribution of words in the corpus.

Algorithms and Techniques used:
- Tokenization
- Zipf's Law (for word frequence anakysis)
